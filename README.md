# Sim2Editor - A The Sims 2 GBA and NDS SAV Editor + Save Researches.

NOTE: This repo has different branches with different purposes.

## Branches
- [External-Tools](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ/Sim2Editor/tree/External-Tools/): The branch for my External Tools while researching the SAVFile. You can find Tools there which may help you by manually editing your SAVFile with an Hex Editor. This is the most active branch right now with a Checksum-Updater and an NDS Last Saved Slot Detector.
