# Sim2Editor - External Tools
You can find a few External Tools on this branch, such as an Checksum-Updater Tool written by me.

Everything on this branch is in `C++`.

## Tools

**You can find all External Tools listed here.**

- [Checksum-Updater](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ/Sim2Editor/tree/External-Tools/Checksum-Updater): A Tool which can update and fix invalid Checksums for the SAVSlots. Useful if you prefer manually Hex Editing the SAVFile and after it, use it directly.

- [LSSD](https://github.com/SuperSaiyajinStackZ/Sim2Editor/tree/External-Tools/LSSD): **LSSD**, also known as **L**ast **S**aved **S**lot **D**etector, a Tool which detects the 3 in game base SAVSlots on the NDS version. The game stores 5 of them.. tho only 3 are loadable in game.
